Read SNAPSHOT.yaml at session start to understand current project state and focus.
Read CONTEXT.md for the full project-os contract, edit policy, and invariants.

## What This Repo Tracks
- Features, requirements, ADRs, and tasks for evolving the project-os template
- The template itself lives in `~/Dev/repos/project-os` — changes planned here are implemented there
- This repo is the planning/tracking layer; the template repo is the implementation target
